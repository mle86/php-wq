# Reference: `Job` interface

Declaration: <code>interface mle86\WQ\Job\\<b>Job</b> implements \Serializable</code>  
Source file: [src/WQ/Job/Job.php](/src/WQ/Job/Job.php)

A Job is a representation of some task to do.
It can be stored in a Work Queue with `WorkServerAdapter::storeJob()`.

This interface extends [`\Serializable`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.serializable.php),
because all Jobs have to be serializable
in order to be stored in a Work Queue.

For your own Job classes,
see the [`AbstractJob`](AbstractJob) base class instead;
it is easier to work with
as it provides default implementations
for the required methods.

This interface does not specify how a Job should be executed
or how the responsible method(s) should be named,
if they are part of the Job implementation at all.


## Methods:

* <code>public function <b>jobCanRetry</b> () : bool</code>  
    Whether this job can be retried later.
    The [WorkProcessor] helper class will check this if job execution has failed.  
    If it returns true, the job will be stored in the Work Queue again
    to be re-executed after `jobRetryDelay()` seconds;
    if it returns false, the job will be buried for later inspection.

* <code>public function <b>jobRetryDelay</b> () : ?int</code>  
    How many seconds the job should be delayed in the Work Quere before being re-tried.
    If `jobCanRetry()` is true,
    this must return a positive integer
    (or zero, if the job should be re-tried as soon as possible).

* <code>public function <b>jobTryIndex</b> () : int</code>  
    On the first try, this must return `1`,
    on the first retry, this must return `2`,
    and so on.

* <code>public function <b>jobIsExpired</b> () : bool</code>  
    Return `true` here if the instance should be considered expired.
    The [WorkServerAdapter] implementations will still return expired instances,
    but the [WorkProcessor] class won't process them â€“
    they will be deleted as soon as they are encountered.
    Always return `false` here if your job class cannot expire.
